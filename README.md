## Technical Architecture

### Services

- **ProjectGutenbergService** - Handles API integration with Project Gutenberg

  - Fetches metadata and plain text content
  - Cleans texts by removing Project Gutenberg headers/footers
  - Supports multiple text formats (UTF-8, ASCII)

- **CutUpGenerator** - Implements the literary cut-up technique
  - Splits text into lines
  - Randomizes order for experimental poetry
  - Preserves original formatting where possible

### Models

- **SourceText** - Stores imported literary works

  - Tracks Project Gutenberg IDs to prevent duplicates
  - Validates content presence and title
  - Associated with generated poems

- **Poem** - Stores generated cut-up poetry
  - Links to source text for traceability
  - Preserves creative output for review

## The Cut-Up Technique

The cut-up technique is a literary method in which written text is cut up and rearranged to create new text. Originally developed by artist Brion Gysin and popularized by writer William S. Burroughs, this method reveals hidden meanings and creates unexpected juxtapositions.

LexiForge automates this process digitally, allowing you to:

- Experiment with classic literature in new ways
- Discover unexpected connections between passages
- Create unique poetic compositions from prose
- Explore the intersection of tradition and avant-garde

## API Integration Details

### Project Gutenberg URLs

LexiForge attempts to fetch texts from multiple URL patterns:

```
/files/{id}/{id}-0.txt      # UTF-8 format
/files/{id}/{id}.txt        # ASCII format
/cache/epub/{id}/pg{id}.txt # Alternative format
```

## Deployment

### Production Setup

1. Set all required environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Ensure PostgreSQL and Redis are available
3. Run database migrations: `rails db:migrate`
4. Seed the database: `rails db:seed`
5. Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS
6. Configure your web server (nginx, Apache) to proxy to the Rails app

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or build production images
docker build -t lexiforge-api .
docker build -t lexiforge-frontend ./frontend
```
