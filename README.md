## 🎨 The Cut-Up Technique

The cut-up technique is a literary method in which written text is cut up and rearranged to create new text. Originally developed by artist Brion Gysin and popularized by writer William S. Burroughs, this method reveals hidden meanings and creates unexpected juxtapositions.

LexiForge automates this process digitally, allowing you to:

- Experiment with classic literature in new ways
- Discover unexpected connections between passages
- Create unique poetic compositions from prose
- Explore the intersection of tradition and avant-garde

## 🔧 API Integration Details

### Project Gutenberg URLs

LexiForge attempts to fetch texts from multiple URL patterns:

```
/files/{id}/{id}-0.txt      # UTF-8 format
/files/{id}/{id}.txt        # ASCII format
/cache/epub/{id}/pg{id}.txt # Alternative format
```
